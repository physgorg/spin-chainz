# spin-chainz
sdp algorithms for ground state of spin chains


################################

pauli_SDP_lib defines custom class for Pauli strings and their algebra

Automatically sets up SDP problem and solves


Features currently in-progress: 
	- Adding commutator constraints with Hamiltonian
	- Extracting correlation functions from optimal results
	- automating the definition of operator bases
